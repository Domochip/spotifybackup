# spotifybackup

This Docker  image allows you to automate a full backup of your Spotify Library every day using [Spotishell PS module](https://github.com/wardbox/spotishell).  
This full backup can be used to be restored over your account or another one.  

# Prerequisites

You first need to create a Spotify Application.

**Step1**: Go to the [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) Dashboard and create an app:  
 - App name : `spotifybackup`
 - App description : `spotifybackup`
 - Redirect URI : `http://127.0.0.1:8080/spotishell`

**Step2**: Collect Client ID and Secret

# Setup connection to Spotify

To setup Spotify connection, you need to run the image in "setup mode" using this commandline and follow instruction:  
`docker run -it --rm -v spotifybackup:/data --entrypoint pwsh domochip/spotifybackup setup.ps1`

### E.g:  
Provide Client ID and Client Secret then copy authorization URL:  
![setup1.png](https://github.com/Domochip/spotifybackup/raw/master/img/setup1.png)  
Paste authorization URL in your browser, read then accept:  
![setup2.png](https://github.com/Domochip/spotifybackup/raw/master/img/setup2.png)  
Copy the redirected url from the address bar:  
![setup3.png](https://github.com/Domochip/spotifybackup/raw/master/img/setup3.png)  
Paste it into the setup container window (you should then receive a green result):  
![setup4.png](https://github.com/Domochip/spotifybackup/raw/master/img/setup4.png) 

**Resulting connection information are then stored into the `spotifybackup` docker volume**

# Run spotifybackup

Docker Quick-Run  
```bash
docker run \
    -d \
